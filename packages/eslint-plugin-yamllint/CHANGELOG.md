## 0.1.1

### Patch Changes

- d8f16ea: Ship README and LICENSE in published npm tarballs

  `pack:npm` now copies each package's `README.md` and the workspace-root
  `LICENSE` into `dist/source/` (the directory `publishConfig.directory`
  redirects publishing to), and the published `package.json` carries a
  `license` field. A package-level `README`/`LICENSE`/`license` overrides the
  shared root one. Re-publishes every package so the first release's missing
  docs are corrected.

## 0.1.0
